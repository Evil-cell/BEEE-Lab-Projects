Aim : To design an automatic night light lamp.


Material Required : Arduino, LDR, LED, Resistor (10K, 220), wires, Breadboard

Procedure

1 Take an ardiuno uno,a breadboard,LER sensor resistance and some jumper wire.

2 Connect LDR,LED and resistance to the breadboard and also connect them to the ardiuno through jumoer wires.

3 connect posituve terminla of the LED to the digital pin specified in the program and make a comman ground for all the negative terminal.

4 Now connect the LER sensor to the A0 pin in the analog section.

5 Also connet the sutiable resistance to protect the circuit from getting damaged.

6 Now write a program for the Automatic night lamp in the ardiuno and uplode it to the board.

                                                                           POINTS TO REMEMBER

1 Before uploding the program to the board always select the correct port and the board which you are using.

2 Always remember the connection pattern of the breadboard while making connections. Top and bottom rows of the breadboard are connected horizontally 
  and middel rails are connected vertically that to only upto five rows.

3 Always connect your instrunment to the pin which you have defined in the program otherwise your setup will not work.

4 Connect a sutiable  resistance with switch to protect it from getting damaged.

5 All the codes of the Ardiuno is written in c and it is case sensitive so make sure you are using correct syntax.

                            
                                                                            LEARNING OUTCOMES

1 Better understanding of the Ardunio and C programing.

2 We aquire some knowdlege about LDR sensors.

3 Familiarity with new Ardunio IED.
