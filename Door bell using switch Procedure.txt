Aim : To design a door bell using push button


Material Required : Ardunio uno board, breadboard,jumper wires,busser,a switch,resistance,Power supply.


Procedure

1 Take an ardiuno uno,a breadboard,a switch,buzzer and some jumper wires for makeing connections.

2 Connect buzzer,switch and resistance to the breadboard and also connect them to the ardiuno through jumoer wires.

3 connect the negative terminal of the switch to the ground of digital pin another pin to the 5V power supply.

4 Now connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to the digital pin which you have defined in the program and negative terminal to the ground in the power
  supply section.

5 Also connect a sutiable resistance with switch to protect it from getting damaged.

6 Now write a program for the door bell using switch in the ardiuno and uplode it to the board .


                                                                           POINTS TO REMEMBER

1 Before uploding the program to the board always select the correct port and the board which you are using.

2 Always remember the connection pattern of the breadboard while making connections. Top and bottom rows of the breadboard are connected horizontally 
  and middel rails are connected vertically that to only upto five rows.

3 Always connect your instrunment to the pin which you have defined in the program otherwise your setup will not work.

4 Connect a sutiable  resistance with switch to protect it from getting damaged.

5 All the codes of the Ardiuno is written in c and it is case sensitive so make sure you are using correct syntax.


                                                                            LEARNING OUTCOMES

1 Better understanding of the Ardunio and C programing.

2 We aquire some knowdlege about equipments used with breadboard.

3 Familiarity with new Ardunio IED.
